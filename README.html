This archive contains NEURON code associated with:

McDougal, R. A., Hines, M. L., & Lytton, W. W. (2013). Reaction-diffusion
    in the NEURON simulator. Frontiers in neuroinformatics, 7.

These model files were supplied by Robert A. McDougal.

Files:

bistablewave.py -- The code for the model of Figure 1. The graph in that figure
                   was made with NEURON's GUI controls.
                   
bistablewave-full-infrastructure.py -- An expanded version of bistablewave.py,
                                       with code for storing state values,
                                       plotting, and more courtesy of Alexandra
                                       Seidenstein.

README.html -- this file

speed.py -- Generates an approximation of Figure 6. Use more alpha values to
            match the figure exactly.

Usage:
-----
Running
nrngui bistablewave-full-infrastructure.py
in less than a minute will produce graphs like these:

<img src="./figure_1.png" alt="figure 1" width="550">
<img src="./figure_2.png" alt="figure 2" width="550">

Running
nrngui speed.py
in a minute or so will generate the following figure:
